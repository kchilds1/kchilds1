My name is Kenneth Childs Jr.  I've been in IT as an IT Analyst for a few years.  I've recently shifted my focus towards becoming a developer. 

### Accomplishments:
* During my time as an IT Analyst I learned some scripting languages to make my job easier when management request repetitive task in bulk. I was able to use R whenever managers would need specific information about multiple devices.  The process of looking up this information one at a time would have taken me over 30 min.  I was able to turn the task into a 3 min one.
* While working at my previous company, I would get tickets for applications to be installed on over 50 computers at a time. This process would normally take several weeks due to scheduling with someone local to the site. So I created a powershell script to install the application on all 50 computers at once. Situations like this inspired me to move towards a developer path. I'm always trying to think of ways to simplify a process or how can I make a design easier for the end user to navigate with.
